# My Prompts

This file keeps track of the prompts used to build this portfolio.

## 1. Initial Setup & Debugging
> Explain what this problem is and help me fix it: This JSX tag requires the module path 'react/jsx-runtime' to exist, but none could be found. Make sure you have types for the appropriate package installed. @[c:\Users\emman\OneDrive\Documents\src\Antigravity\cf_ai_portfolio\src\components\education.tsx:L15]

## 2. Dark Mode & Layout Cleanup
> Add a dark mode switch at the bottom left, the main container will toggle between a dark blue and an offwhite. I think the current layout for text is ugly, get rid of the rounded box and let the text rest directly on top of the background, white text for dark background, black for white.

## 3. Accordion Cards (Initial)
> For experience, projects, and extracurriculars, each entry should start out shrunk. Make a nice rectanglular card with only the job title, company, and time of work. The card should be clickable and will expand to show tthe list items, when clicked again it will shrink back down. No two cards of one component should be able to be expanded at the same time.

## 4. Accordion Cards (Fixes)
> The cards don't expand on click. Also there should be no overflow past the 100vh from container to container, essentially expanding one card should also hide the rest. Add a grayscale svg of two arrows pointing away from each other diagonally for shrunk cards and they point at each other for expanded cards.
